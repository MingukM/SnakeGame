# SnakeGame
My very first personal project to build my portfolio.
## Goals
I am interested in making games, so I have decided to make a simple snake game using java.

This project will serve as a tool to teach myself how to use Git and Github. 

I have completed the tutorial. 

I was planning to furnish the game. However, I decided that it would be better to create a new project because the code for this project seems like it was written in a Functional programming langauge even though it was written in Java.

Nonetheless, I have learned a lot from writing this program. Now, I have the general sense on how to code a simple game on Java. Also, I have learned how to operate basic Git commands on my PC.  

### Source
I am following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ) to create the snake game.
