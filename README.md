# SnakeGame
My very first personal project to build my portfolio.
## Goals
I am interested in making games, so I have decided to make a simple snake game using java.

I will follow the tutorial to start making the game. However, I will be making changes to the code when I am done with the tutorial.

Also, this project will serve as a tool to teach myself how to use Git and Github. 

### Source
I am following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ) to create the snake game.
