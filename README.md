# SnakeGame
My very first personal project to build my portfolio.
## Goals
I am interested in making games, so I have decided to make a simple snake game using java.

This project will serve as a tool to teach myself how to use Git and Github. 

I have completed the tutorial. 

However, this tutorial does not provide the explanation for the functions that are being used for making the game. It does not explain why it works and how it works. I simply copied the work that was being done on the video.

Therefore, I will be challenging myself to furnish the game. 
Also, I can only access the game by running the source code. I will teach myself how to make a java program, so I do not have to access the source code to run the game.

### Source
I am following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ) to create the snake game.
