# SnakeGame
My very first personal project to build my portfolio.
## Goals
I am interested in making games, so I have decided to make a simple snake game using java.

I have completed the tutorial. 

However, this tutorial does not provide the explanation for the functions that are being used for making the game. It does not explain why it works and how it works. I simply copied the work that was being done on the video.

Therefore, I will be challenging myself to furnish the game. 
This time I will limit my sources to codes which I already possess and the Java documentation provided on Oracle website.

Also, this project will serve as a tool to teach myself how to use Git and Github. 

### Source
I am following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ) to create the snake game.
